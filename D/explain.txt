Overview:
- Two Windows utilities: `clipboard_jammer.c` (demonstrates a clipboard listener that replaces clipboard content), and `Reverse/clipboard_jammer_fix.c` (restores normal clipboard behavior by closing the jammer and resetting the clipboard).

How it’s solved:
- Jammer: registers as clipboard viewer or listener, opens clipboard on updates, replaces content.
- Fix: locates jammer window/process, terminates it if present, empties and sets a restorative message to the clipboard.

Requirements satisfaction:
- Demonstrates synchronization and event-driven OS mechanisms on Windows (`WM_CLIPBOARDUPDATE`, viewer chain).
- Deterministic behavior on clipboard events; defensive checks for missing APIs.

Basic Viva Questions:
Q: What is the clipboard and how is it used in operating systems?
A: The clipboard is a shared OS resource that allows data to be copied from one application and pasted into another, enabling inter-application data transfer.

Q: What is a clipboard listener or viewer?
A: A clipboard listener/viewer is a program that registers with the OS to be notified whenever the clipboard content changes, allowing it to monitor or react to copy/paste events.

Q: What is the difference between a Windows message and an event?
A: A message is a notification sent to a window about user or system actions. An event is a synchronization primitive used by threads. `WM_CLIPBOARDUPDATE` is a message.

Q: What does it mean for a program to be malware or a jammer in the clipboard context?
A: A clipboard jammer hijacks clipboard changes and replaces content without user consent, disrupting normal copy-paste operations and potentially stealing or corrupting data.

Q: Why is the clipboard a shared resource and what are the security implications?
A: Multiple applications access the clipboard; without proper synchronization, race conditions can occur. Security concerns include data leakage (sensitive copied text) and unauthorized modification.

Viva prompts:
- Difference between legacy clipboard viewer chain and modern `AddClipboardFormatListener`.
- Why the clipboard is a shared OS resource and typical race/permission issues.
- How to detect and shut down a misbehaving listener.
- Portability: why these programs are Windows-only and how to adapt for Linux (X11 selections, Wayland limitations).
Answers:
- Viewer chain vs listener: viewer chain uses `SetClipboardViewer` and links windows; if one dies the chain can break; `AddClipboardFormatListener` registers independent listeners on a system list with less coupling and supports UWP. Listener is preferred for robustness and fewer chain-repair duties.
- Shared resource: the clipboard is global state guarded by the OS; races happen when multiple apps poll/modify simultaneously or hold the clipboard open too long; permission prompts appear in sandboxed/UWP contexts and on elevated/low-integrity crossings; always open/close quickly and check return codes.
- Detect/shut down: enumerate top-level windows for known class/title, send `WM_CLOSE`, and if needed terminate the process by PID; you can also watch for stuck `WM_CLIPBOARDUPDATE` storms and log the originating handle before killing it; after stopping it, empty the clipboard and set benign text.
- Portability: this code relies on Win32 messaging and HGLOBAL clipboard APIs; on X11 you would use selections (`PRIMARY`/`CLIPBOARD`) via XFixes or gtk/Qt hooks, but ownership is transient; Wayland restricts global clipboard snooping so a jammer/fix is usually impossible without compositor support.
